# SuperheroApp
An Application that shows a great list of Superheroes.

You can click on a superhero's card and you will get
more interesting details about them.

When you are in the details screen you can click on
each of the sections to expand the information. 

Sections are as follows: 
- Powerstats.
- Biography. 
- Appearance. 
- Work. 
- Connections. 

During the development of this project I used the
Retrofit and Moshi libraries to get the data internet. 

This project uses MVVM architectural pattern with dataBinding 
and LiveData. 

Enjoy the app!!
